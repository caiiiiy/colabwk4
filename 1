- The image is segmented into three main clusters, with distinct boundaries between them.
- The color scale represents different cluster assignments, ranging from dark purple (-1) to yellow (1).
- The clustering appears to group pixels based on spectral similarities, with a large homogeneous region and smaller distinct areas.

### GMM Implementation

- The model assigns cluster labels probabilistically, creating smoother transitions between regions.
- The color scale represents different cluster labels, ranging from dark purple (-1) to yellow (1).
- The GMM clustering captures fine details in the data, especially in the central and upper-right areas, where variations in spectral features are evident.

### Altimetry Classification

- This plot visualizes the mean values and standard deviation for two classes, ice and lead, within a dataset. The x-axis represents an unknown variable, possibly time steps or pixel indices, while the y-axis likely represents intensity or reflectance values. The solid lines indicate the mean values for each class, with ice shown in blue and lead in orange. The shaded regions surrounding the lines represent the standard deviation, indicating the variability of the data at each point.
- The lead class (orange) exhibits significantly higher variability compared to the ice class (blue), as seen in the larger shaded region. This suggests that lead has a more diverse distribution, which could be due to variations in environmental factors, measurement noise, or differing physical properties. On the other hand, the ice class appears to be more stable, with a narrower range of values.
- One key observation is the peak in the middle of the plot, where both classes show a concentration of values. The spread of the lead class is more pronounced, which might indicate a more dynamic behavior in this region. It would be useful to analyze whether this variation is due to natural differences in the dataset or external factors like sensor sensitivity.

- This histogram represents the echo intensity distribution for the lead cluster in the dataset.
- The echoes are highly concentrated around a specific range, forming a distinct peak near the center (~100-120). The surrounding regions have very few occurrences, leading to a sharp distribution.
- This suggests that the lead cluster has a relatively narrow range of echo intensities, possibly due to the homogeneous nature of the surface.

### Scatter Plots of Clustered Data

- This histogram shows the echo intensity distribution for the sea ice cluster in the dataset.
- Unlike the lead cluster, this plot has a wider distribution with multiple peaks, indicating greater variability in sea ice echoes. Values span across a broad range, with a primary peak around 100-130 and additional fluctuations at higher intensity levels.
- The broader and more scattered distribution suggests that sea ice surfaces exhibit greater diversity in their reflective properties, potentially due to variations in ice thickness, roughness, or snow cover.

- This scatter plot visualizes the clustering results with sig_0 (x-axis) and PP (y-axis).
- The two distinct colors represent different clusters obtained from the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM).
- The clusters appear well-separated, with one cluster (yellow) having higher PP values, while the other cluster (dark purple) remains lower.

- This plot maps sig_0 (x-axis) against SSD (y-axis).
- The dark purple cluster is concentrated around SSD = 0, while the yellow cluster is spread towards negative values.
- There is a visible negative correlation between sig_0 and SSD, suggesting that one cluster has systematically lower SSD values.

- This scatter plot displays PP (x-axis) against SSD (y-axis).
- The clusters appear distinct, with one cluster (yellow) having low SSD values and another (dark purple) having a wider spread.
- This suggests that PP and SSD may serve as strong distinguishing features for clustering.

### Waveform Alignment Using Cross-Correlation

![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fab6fec7-3f2f-4fb1-a1e0-642a5ed561f7)

- This plot visualizes 10 equally spaced waveforms from the dataset where clusters_gmm = 0.
- The waveforms have been aligned using cross-correlation, ensuring that similar features line up across different series.
- A sharp peak around index ~150 is present in most waveforms, indicating a common event or feature in the dataset.
- Some waveforms (e.g., the red one) deviate significantly before the peak, suggesting variations within the cluster.

### Compare with ESA data

- This classification report provides a detailed evaluation of a binary classification model’s performance. The confusion matrix shows that the model correctly identified **8,856 instances** of class `0.0` and **3,293 instances** of class `1.0`, with only **22 false positives** and **24 false negatives**. The low number of misclassifications suggests the model is performing exceptionally well.  
- Looking at the precision and recall metrics, class `0.0` has a **precision of 1.00**, meaning there are no false positives, while class `1.0` has a **precision of 0.99**, indicating very few instances were incorrectly classified as `1.0`. Similarly, recall values are **1.00 for class 0.0** and **0.99 for class 1.0**, suggesting that the model correctly identifies nearly all instances of both classes. The **F1-scores** follow the same pattern, showing a well-balanced trade-off between precision and recall for both classes.  
- The overall model accuracy is **1.00**, which indicates near-perfect classification. While this is a great result, it is essential to ensure that the model is not overfitting. Testing on a completely separate validation dataset could help determine whether the model generalizes well. Additionally, analyzing the misclassified cases could provide insights into potential weaknesses, such as ambiguous samples or noisy data.  
- If the dataset is imbalanced, techniques like **Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE)** or cost-sensitive learning could help further refine performance. Another useful approach would be to visualize the model’s behavior using **ROC curves** or **precision-recall curves**, which can provide more insights into how the model performs under different decision thresholds.
